1. If we have let's say one single algorithm to solve problems, we can represent all problems as a single representation and pass it as an input to this algorithm.
2. There should be a uniform way to convert any computational problem into a single representation.
3. Afterwards, I give this uniform representation to an AI system and that AI system will be able to solve it.
4. That single representation is what we call state.
5. We will define a set of states.
