1. A black box = Goal Test which tells an angent whether given state is a goal state or not. Input=Current State, Output=Yes/No
2. Gives list of states where I can reach from current state in one step by taking operator/cost/actions. Black Box = Expand Function
3. Black Box = Initial state to start from
4. There can be many goal states. So it is always 'a goal state' and not the 'the goal state'.
